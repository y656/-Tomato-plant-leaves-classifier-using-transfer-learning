# Tomato plant leaves classifier using Transfer learning in Computer vision

This repository contains code for implementation of Mobilenet v2 architecture in agriculture domain to identify different diseases occuring in tomato plants.
I have used MobilenetV2 for the purpose of Transfer Learning because it is less computationally expensive and perfect fit for deloying in Mobile devices and Computers without GPU.

## Introduction:

### Dataset:
The data for this repository is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease. 


###Overview:


### Results:

This model got an accuracy of 99.06 percentage which indicates our model is performing good on new data.
